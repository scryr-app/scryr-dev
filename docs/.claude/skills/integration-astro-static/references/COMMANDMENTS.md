# Framework rules

Follow these when integrating PostHog into this framework.

- A missing PostHog configuration must never break the app — read keys optionally (never a required setting), guard init and capture behind their presence, and keep build and boot working with no PostHog environment set — but never silently: in development or debug builds fail loudly, using the language's idiomatic error, with the message "<VAR> variable required by PostHog is missing or un-configured, this causes events to be silently missed. This error stops appearing once <VAR> is configured" (substituting the actual variable name); production stays a no-op
- Always use the is:inline directive on PostHog script tags to prevent Astro from processing them and causing TypeScript errors
- Use PUBLIC_ prefix for client-side environment variables in Astro (e.g., PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN)
- Create a posthog.astro component in src/components/ for reusable initialization across pages
- Import the PostHog component in a Layout and wrap all pages with that layout
- Remember that source code is available in the node_modules directory
- Check package.json for type checking or build scripts to validate changes
- When identity comes from framework-bridged state (Inertia or SSR shared props, a serialized session), confirm the backend actually shares that field — add the share server-side if missing — before identifying from it
- When a reverse proxy is configured, both /static/* AND /array/* must route to the assets origin (us-assets.i.posthog.com or eu-assets.i.posthog.com).
- posthog-js is the JavaScript SDK package name
- posthog.init() MUST be called before any other PostHog methods (capture, identify, etc.)
- posthog-js is browser-only — do NOT import it in Node.js or server-side contexts (use posthog-node instead)
- Autocapture is ON by default with posthog-js (tracks clicks, form submissions, pageviews). Keep autocapture enabled unless the user explicitly asks to turn it off.
- NEVER send PII in posthog.capture() event properties — no emails, full names, phone numbers, physical addresses, IP addresses, or user-generated content
- PII belongs in posthog.identify() person properties (email, name, role), NOT in capture() event properties
- Call posthog.identify(userId, { email, name, role }) on login AND on page refresh if the user is already logged in
- Call posthog.reset() on logout — the transition out of an identified session, never an initially anonymous page load (that discards the anonymous id and its history) — and before identify() when switching directly between accounts
- For SPAs without a framework router, capture pageviews with posthog.capture($pageview) or use the capture_pageview history_change option in init for History API routing
- When verifying with an automated browser (Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium), posthog-js's bot filter silently drops every capture while flags and asset loads still succeed. Override navigator.webdriver, the user agent, AND navigator.userAgentData before concluding events do not send. Diagnose with ?__posthog_debug=true ("likely bot" in the console).
